<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I'm</span> washed up," Preston
growled bitterly. "They
made a postman out of me.
Me&mdash;a postman!"</p>

<p>He crumpled the assignment
memo into a small, hard
ball and hurled it at the
bristly image of himself in
the bar mirror. He hadn't
shaved in three days&mdash;which
was how long it had been
since he had been notified of
his removal from Space Patrol
Service and his transfer
to Postal Delivery.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Preston felt a
hand on his shoulder. He
looked up and saw a man in
the trim gray of a Patrolman's
uniform.</p>

<p>"What do you want,
Dawes?"</p>

<p>"Chief's been looking for
you, Preston. It's time for
you to get going on your run."</p>

<p>Preston scowled. "Time to
go deliver the mail, eh?" He
spat. "Don't they have anything
better to do with good
spacemen than make letter
carriers out of them?"</p>

<hr />

<p>The other man shook his
head. "You won't get anywhere
grousing about it,
Preston. Your papers don't
specify which branch you're
assigned to, and if they want
to make you carry the mail&mdash;that's
it." His voice became
suddenly gentle. "Come on,
Pres. One last drink, and
then let's go. You don't want
to spoil a good record, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No," Preston said reflectively.
He gulped his drink
and stood up. "Okay. I'm
ready. Neither snow nor rain
shall stay me from my appointed
rounds, or however
the damned thing goes."</p>

<p>"That's a smart attitude,
Preston. Come on&mdash;I'll walk
you over to Administration."</p>

<hr />

<p>Savagely, Preston ripped
away the hand that the other
had put around his shoulders.
"I can get there myself. At
least give me credit for that!"</p>

<p>"Okay," Dawes said, shrugging.
"Well&mdash;good luck,
Preston."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Thanks. Thanks
real lots."</p>

<p>He pushed his way past the
man in Space Grays and
shouldered past a couple of
barflies as he left. He pushed
open the door of the bar and
stood outside for a moment.</p>

<p>It was near midnight, and
the sky over Nome Spaceport
was bright with stars. Preston's
trained eye picked out
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus. There
they were&mdash;waiting. But he
would spend the rest of his
days ferrying letters on the
Ganymede run.</p>

<p>He sucked in the cold night
air of summertime Alaska
and squared his shoulders.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two hours later, Preston
sat at the controls of a one-man
patrol ship just as he
had in the old days. Only the
control panel was bare where
the firing studs for the heavy
guns was found in regular
patrol ships. And in the cargo
hold instead of crates of
spare ammo there were three
bulging sacks of mail destined
for the colony on Ganymede.</p>

<p><i>Slight difference</i>, Preston
thought, as he set up his
blasting pattern.</p>

<p>"Okay, Preston," came the
voice from the tower. "You've
got clearance."</p>

<p>"Cheers," Preston said,
and yanked the blast-lever.
The ship jolted upward, and
for a second he felt a little
of the old thrill&mdash;until he remembered.</p>

<p>He took the ship out in
space, saw the blackness in
the viewplate. The radio
crackled.</p>

<p>"Come in, Postal Ship.
Come in, Postal Ship."</p>

<p>"I'm in. What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"We're your convoy," a
hard voice said. "Patrol Ship
08756, Lieutenant Mellors,
above you. Down at three
o'clock, Patrol Ship 10732,
Lieutenant Gunderson. We'll
take you through the Pirate
Belt."</p>

<p>Preston felt his face go hot
with shame. Mellors! Gunderson!
They would stick two of
his old sidekicks on the job
of guarding him.</p>

<p>"Please acknowledge," Mellors
said.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/001.png" width="324" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<small><b>"The iceworms were not expecting any mail&mdash;just the mailman."</b></small></div>

<p>Preston paused. Then:
"Postal Ship 1872, Lieutenant
Preston aboard. I acknowledge
message."</p>

<p>There was a stunned silence.
"<i>Preston?</i> Hal Preston?"</p>

<p>"The one and only," Preston
said.</p>

<p>"What are you doing on a
Postal ship?" Mellors asked.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask the
Chief that? He's the one who
yanked me out of the Patrol
and put me here."</p>

<p>"Can you beat that?" Gunderson
asked incredulously.
"Hal Preston, on a Postal
ship."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Incredible, isn't it?"
Preston asked bitterly. "You
can't believe your ears. Well,
you better believe it, because
here I am."</p>

<p>"Must be some clerical
error," Gunderson said.</p>

<p>"Let's change the subject,"
Preston snapped.</p>

<p>They were silent for a few
moments, as the three ships&mdash;two
armed, one loaded with
mail for Ganymede&mdash;streaked
outward away from Earth.
Manipulating his controls
with the ease of long experience,
Preston guided the ship
smoothly toward the gleaming
bulk of far-off Jupiter.
Even at this distance, he
could see five or six bright
pips surrounding the huge
planet. There was Callisto,
and&mdash;ah&mdash;there was Ganymede.</p>

<p>He made computations,
checked his controls, figured
orbits. Anything to keep from
having to talk to his two ex-Patrolmates
or from having
to think about the humiliating
job he was on. Anything to&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>Pirates! Moving up at two
o'clock!</i>"</p>

<p>Preston came awake. He
picked off the location of the
pirate ships&mdash;there were two
of them, coming up out of the
asteroid belt. Small, deadly,
compact, they orbited toward
him.</p>

<p>He pounded the instrument
panel in impotent rage, looking
for the guns that weren't
there.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Pres," came
Mellors' voice. "We'll take
care of them for you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Preston said bitterly.
He watched as the pirate
ships approached, longing
to trade places with the
men in the Patrol ships above
and below him.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright spear of
flame lashed out across space
and the hull of Gunderson's
ship glowed cherry red. "I'm
okay," Gunderson reported
immediately. "Screens took
the charge."</p>

<p>Preston gripped his controls
and threw the ship into
a plunging dive that dropped
it back behind the protection
of both Patrol ships. He saw
Gunderson and Mellors converge
on one of the pirates.
Two blue beams licked out,
and the pirate ship exploded.</p>

<p>But then the second pirate
swooped down in an unexpected
dive. "Look out!"
Preston yelled helplessly&mdash;but
it was too late. Beams ripped
into the hull of Mellors' ship,
and a dark fissure line opened
down the side of the ship.
Preston smashed his hand
against the control panel.
Better to die in an honest
dogfight than to live this
way!</p>

<p>It was one against one,
now&mdash;Gunderson against the
pirate. Preston dropped back
again to take advantage of
the Patrol ship's protection.</p>

<p>"I'm going to try a diversionary
tactic," Gunderson
said on untappable tight-beam.
"Get ready to cut under
and streak for Ganymede
with all you got."</p>

<p>"Check."</p>

<p>Preston watched as the
tactic got under way. Gunderson's
ship traveled in a long,
looping spiral that drew the
pirate into the upper quadrant
of space. His path free,
Preston guided his ship under
the other two and toward unobstructed
freedom. As he
looked back, he saw Gunderson
steaming for the pirate
on a sure collision orbit.</p>

<p>He turned away. The score
was two Patrolmen dead, two
ships wrecked&mdash;but the mails
would get through.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, Preston
leaned forward over his control
board and headed on toward
Ganymede.</p>

<hr />

<p>The blue-white, frozen
moon hung beneath him.
Preston snapped on the radio.</p>

<p>"Ganymede Colony? Come
in, please. This is your Postal
Ship." The words tasted sour
in his mouth.</p>

<p>There was silence for a
second. "Come in, Ganymede,"
Preston repeated impatiently&mdash;and
then the
sound of a distress signal cut
across his audio pickup.</p>

<p>It was coming on wide
beam from the satellite below&mdash;and
they had cut out all receiving
facilities in an attempt
to step up their transmitter.
Preston reached for
the wide-beam stud, pressed
it.</p>

<p>"Okay, I pick up your signal,
Ganymede. Come in,
now!"</p>

<p>"This is Ganymede," a
tense voice said. "We've got
trouble down here. Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"Mail ship," Preston said.
"From Earth. What's going
on?"</p>

<p>There was the sound of
voices whispering somewhere
near the microphone. Finally:
"Hello, Mail Ship?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"You're going to have to
turn back to Earth, fellow.
You can't land here. It's
rough on us, missing a mail
trip, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Preston said impatiently,
"Why can't I land? What the
devil's going on down there?"</p>

<p>"We've been invaded," the
tired voice said. "The colony's
been completely surrounded
by iceworms."</p>

<p>"Iceworms?"</p>

<p>"The local native life," the
colonist explained. "They're
about thirty feet long, a foot
wide, and mostly mouth.
There's a ring of them about
a hundred yards wide surrounding
the Dome. They can't get in and
we can't get out&mdash;and we can't figure
out any possible approach for
you."</p>

<p>"Pretty," Preston said.
"But why didn't the things
bother you while you were
building your Dome?"</p>

<p>"Apparently they have a
very long hibernation-cycle.
We've only been here two
years, you know. The iceworms
must all have been
asleep when we came. But
they came swarming out of
the ice by the hundreds last
month."</p>

<p>"How come Earth doesn't
know?"</p>

<p>"The antenna for our long-range
transmitter was outside
the Dome. One of the
worms came by and chewed
the antenna right off. All
we've got left is this short-range
thing we're using and
it's no good more than ten
thousand miles from here.
You're the first one who's
been this close since it happened."</p>

<p>"I get it." Preston closed
his eyes for a second, trying
to think things out.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Colony was under
blockade by hostile alien life,
thereby making it impossible
for him to deliver the mail.
Okay. If he'd been a regular
member of the Postal Service,
he'd have given it up as a
bad job and gone back to
Earth to report the difficulty.</p>

<p><i>But I'm not going back.
I'll be the best damned mailman
they've got.</i></p>

<p>"Give me a landing orbit
anyway, Ganymede."</p>

<p>"But you can't come down!
How will you leave your
ship?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that,"
Preston said calmly.</p>

<p>"We have to worry! We
don't dare open the Dome,
with those creatures outside.
You <i>can't</i> come down, Postal
Ship."</p>

<p>"You want your mail or
don't you?"</p>

<p>The colonist paused.
"Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay, then," Preston said.
"Shut up and give me landing
coordinates!"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and
then the figures started coming
over. Preston jotted them
down on a scratch-pad.</p>

<p>"Okay, I've got them. Now
sit tight and wait." He
glanced contemptuously at
the three mail-pouches behind
him, grinned, and started
setting up the orbit.</p>

<p><i>Mailman, am I? I'll show
them!</i></p>

<hr />

<p>He brought the Postal Ship
down with all the skill of his
years in the Patrol, spiralling
in around the big satellite of
Jupiter as cautiously and as
precisely as if he were zeroing
in on a pirate lair in the
asteroid belt. In its own way,
this was as dangerous, perhaps
even more so.</p>

<p>Preston guided the ship
into an ever-narrowing orbit,
which he stabilized about a
hundred miles over the surface
of Ganymede. As his
ship swung around the
moon's poles in its tight orbit,
he began to figure some fuel
computations.</p>

<p>His scratch-pad began to
fill with notations.</p>

<p><i>Fuel storage&mdash;</i></p>

<p><i>Escape velocity&mdash;</i></p>

<p><i>Margin of error&mdash;</i></p>

<p><i>Safety factor&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Finally he looked up. He
had computed exactly how
much spare fuel he had, how
much he could afford to
waste. It was a small figure&mdash;too
small, perhaps.</p>

<p>He turned to the radio.
"Ganymede?"</p>

<p>"Where are you, Postal
Ship?"</p>

<p>"I'm in a tight orbit about
a hundred miles up," Preston
said. "Give me the figures on
the circumference of your
Dome, Ganymede?"</p>

<p>"Seven miles," the colonist
said. "What are you planning
to do?"</p>

<p>Preston didn't answer. He
broke contact and scribbled
some more figures. Seven
miles of iceworms, eh? That
was too much to handle. He
had planned on dropping
flaming fuel on them and
burning them out, but he
couldn't do it that way.</p>

<p>He'd have to try a different
tactic.</p>

<p>Down below, he could see
the blue-white ammonia ice
that was the frozen atmosphere
of Ganymede. Shimmering
gently amid the whiteness was the
transparent yellow of the Dome
beneath whose curved walls
lived the Ganymede Colony.
Even forewarned, Preston
shuddered. Surrounding the
Dome was a living, writhing
belt of giant worms.</p>

<p>"Lovely," he said. "Just
lovely."</p>

<p>Getting up, he clambered
over the mail sacks and
headed toward the rear of the
ship, hunting for the auxiliary
fuel-tanks.</p>

<p>Working rapidly, he lugged
one out and strapped it into
an empty gun turret, making
sure he could get it loose
again when he'd need it.</p>

<p>He wiped away sweat and
checked the angle at which
the fuel-tank would face the
ground when he came down
for a landing. Satisfied, he
knocked a hole in the side of
the fuel-tank.</p>

<p>"Okay, Ganymede," he radioed.
"I'm coming down."</p>

<p>He blasted loose from the
tight orbit and rocked the
ship down on manual. The
forbidding surface of Ganymede
grew closer and closer.
Now he could see the iceworms
plainly.</p>

<p>Hideous, thick creatures,
lying coiled in masses around
the Dome. Preston checked
his spacesuit, making sure it
was sealed. The instruments
told him he was a bare ten
miles above Ganymede now.
One more swing around the
poles would do it.</p>

<p>He peered out as the Dome
came below and once again
snapped on the radio.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I'm going to come down
and burn a path through
those worms of yours. Watch
me carefully, and jump to it
when you see me land. I want
that airlock open, or else."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No buts!"</p>

<p>He was right overhead
now. Just one ordinary-type
gun would solve the whole
problem, he thought. But
Postal Ships didn't get guns.
They weren't supposed to
need them.</p>

<p>He centered the ship as
well as he could on the Dome
below and threw it into automatic
pilot. Jumping from
the control panel, he ran back
toward the gun turret and slammed
shut the plexilite screen.
Its outer wall opened and the
fuel-tank went tumbling outward
and down. He returned
to his control-panel seat and
looked at the viewscreen. He
smiled.</p>

<p>The fuel-tank was lying
near the Dome&mdash;right in the
middle of the nest of iceworms.
The fuel was leaking
from the puncture.</p>

<p>The iceworms writhed in
from all sides.</p>

<p>"Now!" Preston said grimly.</p>

<p>The ship roared down, jets
blasting. The fire licked out,
heated the ground, melted
snow&mdash;ignited the fuel-tank!
A gigantic flame blazed up,
reflected harshly off the
snows of Ganymede.</p>

<p>And the mindless iceworms
came, marching toward the
fire, being consumed, as still
others devoured the bodies of
the dead and dying.</p>

<p>Preston looked away and
concentrated on the business
of finding a place to land the
ship.</p>

<hr />

<p>The holocaust still raged as
he leaped down from the catwalk
of the ship, clutching
one of the heavy mail sacks,
and struggled through the
melting snows to the airlock.</p>

<p>He grinned. The airlock
was open.</p>

<p>Arms grabbed him, pulled
him through. Someone opened
his helmet.</p>

<p>"Great job, Postman!"</p>

<p>"There are two more mail sacks,"
Preston said. "Get
men out after them."</p>

<p>The man in charge gestured
to two young colonists,
who donned spacesuits and
dashed through the airlock.
Preston watched as they
raced to the ship, climbed in,
and returned a few moments
later with the mail sacks.</p>

<p>"You've got it all," Preston
said. "I'm checking out. I'll
get word to the Patrol to get
here and clean up that mess
for you."</p>

<p>"How can we thank you?"
the official-looking man asked.</p>

<p>"No need to," Preston said
casually. "I had to get that
mail down here some way,
didn't I?"</p>

<p>He turned away, smiling to
himself. Maybe the Chief <i>had</i>
known what he was doing
when he took an experienced
Patrol man and dumped him
into Postal. Delivering the
mail to Ganymede had been
more hazardous than fighting
off half a dozen space pirates.
<i>I guess I was wrong</i>, Preston
thought. <i>This is no snap job
for old men.</i></p>

<p>Preoccupied, he started out
through the airlock. The man
in charge caught his arm.
"Say, we don't even know
your name! Here you are a
hero, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hero?" Preston shrugged.
"All I did was deliver the
mail. It's all in a day's work,
you know. The mail's got to
get through!"</p>
